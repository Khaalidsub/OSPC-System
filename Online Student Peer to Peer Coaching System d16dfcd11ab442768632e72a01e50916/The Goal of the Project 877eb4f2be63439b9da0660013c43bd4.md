# The Goal of the Project

The Goal of the Project is to :

- connect with all the university students all around the world
- guide each other using the peer concept
- be a self contained system that does not depend on any payment system

it is a system for students so therefore the goal is that it will not be managed by others but themselves using a voting system. Everything would be voted such as the admin( named president), the department moderators, coach applications, or voting for new additional features to be added within the system.

In order to have those things be secured, it will be stored within a blockchain. This blockchain contains all the transactions, whether it is about the payment or voting , everything that are critical would be stored within the blockchain.
